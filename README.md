I made a surveillance rover with real-time human detection capabilities. The project is developed using Python, OpenCV, MobileNet, and Socket Programming. It allows the rover to capture images and detect humans in real-time, triggering alarms and sending alerts upon detection.

## Features

- Developed a surveillance rover with the ability to detect humans in real time.
- Utilized the MobileNet model architecture for accurate and efficient human detection in the captured images.
- Implemented Socket Programming to trigger alarms and send alerts when humans are detected.

## Requirements

To set up the environment for running this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- MobileNet
- Socket (Socket Programming library)

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mobilenet socket
```

## Usage

To use the surveillance rover with human detection capabilities, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Install the required dependencies (see Requirements section).
3. Connect a camera or webcam to your system for capturing images.
4. Open the `ugv_person.py` file in a text editor.
5. Configure any necessary settings.
